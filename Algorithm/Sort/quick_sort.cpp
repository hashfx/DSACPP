/*
Quick Sort Algorithm (Divide and Conquer)

    Sorts an array by recursively dividing it into two sub-arrays,
    one containing elements less than a chosen pivot element,
    and the other containing elements greater than or equal to the pivot.
    This process repeats until each sub-array contains only one element (sorted).

Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in worst case.

Algorithm:
    > Select a pivot element from the array (e.g., middle element).
    > Partition the array into two sub-arrays:
    > Left: elements less than the pivot.
    > Right: elements greater than or equal to the pivot.
    > Recursively apply Quick Sort to both left and right sub-arrays.
    > Merge the sorted left and right sub-arrays back into the original array.

Output Parameters:
    [In] size of the array[n]
    [In] pointer to the array of elements[arr]
    [Op] sorted array
